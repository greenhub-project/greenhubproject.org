Only the (strictly non personal) data collected via mobile app is stored in a data repository, no other service stores any information. The data that is collected by our platform is stored in a repository, unless otherwise stated.This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services.</p>
            <h2>The short version</h2>
            <p>We collect your information only with your consent; <strong>we DO NOT collect any personal information via our mobile app or any information unique to your mobile device such as phone number, serial or IMEI numbers;</strong> we only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us when using our web app; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Policy describes.</p>
            <p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>
            <h2>What information GreenHub collects and why</h2>
            <h3>Information from the mobile app</h3>
            <p>If you <strong>install and accept the terms of use</strong>, we will periodically collect information regarding the energy consumption of your mobile device. The collection of information is determined by the following events:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Every time the mobile device battery level changes (increases or decreases).
                Once one of these events take place, a sample of data will be gathered by the mobile app and stored locally on the mobile device.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>“Sample” is one instance of a collection of data that includes information such as battery current level, battery voltage, battery temperature, network connectivity details, sensors state (either if they are switched on or off), screen state (on or off), timezone, memory and CPU usage, etc.</p>
            <p>The samples collected via mobile app are sent automatically to our Services. The user may choose to upload the information manually or change on the mobile app preferences the interval of the automatic upload.</p>
            <p>Note that all data collected is purely about the device’s performance and power behavior. No personal user information is collected at any given moment. The mobile devices are identified on the Services by a randomly alphanumeric identifier used to distinguish each device in order to process the data.</p>
            <p>For a complete description of the data collected please refer to our documentation <nuxt-link to="/docs/intro/overview">here</nuxt-link>.</p>
            <h3 class="why">Why do we collect this?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Our strategies to analyze energy consumption behaviors rely on the use of real-world data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Information from users with accounts on the web app</h3>

You will provide your name, an email address and a password, and we will ask you validate your email account by sending a confirmation email to finish the registration process. </p>
            <p>The “User Personal Information” <strong>will not be used anywhere else except on the web app</strong> with the purpose of authenticating the user. This information will not be shared on any other of the Services.</p>
            <p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address and a real name are examples of “User Personal Information.”</p>
